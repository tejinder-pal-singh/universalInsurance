                Expenses like private nursing or making changes to your home or
                vehicle to enhance your mobility are not included in your
                provincial health insurance plan and might not be covered by
                typical employer-sponsored health plans. Additionally, facing a
                critical illness brings about various other challenges, such as
                seeking the best medical care, fulfilling day-to-day needs (like
                taking care of your children), and managing the stress and
                anxiety that comes with it. PII's critical illness insurance
                offers a lump-sum benefit to financially support you if you are
                diagnosed with a covered critical illness and survive. You can
                utilize this benefit payment to supplement your health insurance
                plan and any group disability coverage you may have in the
                following ways: Alleviate financial burden: Pay off or reduce
                your mortgage, credit card bills, or other debts. Keep your
                business running smoothly. Maintain your independence: Make
                modifications to your home or vehicle to enhance your mobility.
                Hire domestic help during your recovery. Fund a leave of absence
                for yourself or your spouse. Access advanced medical services:
                In Canada, pay for medications and treatments not covered by
                provincial health plans. If seeking treatment outside of Canada,
                cover the expenses of treatments that may not be available at
                home, as well as travel and accommodation costs for your family.
                Aid in your recovery as you see fit: Spend more quality time
                with your family or utilize the benefit in any other way that
                helps you focus on getting better.
